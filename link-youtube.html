<h2>Role of development administration and its importance for a country's development</h2>
<br>
<p>The <b> Development Administration </b> as the name suggests it is concerned with the political and socioeconomic development of a country, though its main objective is to build a nation. The concept of development administration emerged during early 50s and 60s of 20th century, just after the 2nd world war, with the emergence of newly independent nations that have came out of the colonial rule, to deal with the central issues of transforming socioeconomic conditions of the newly emerged nations. As it is a simultaneous process of formulation, execution, reformulation and implementation of set of goals in a time period, so it has characteristics such as socioeconomic changes, commitment, being result and client oriented, innovative and motivation.
Development administration being result and relationship oriented focuses on purpose (socioeconomic progress), accountability (for the decision & loyal to its people, Nation and its constitution), and attitude (showing positivity and persuasiveness). Development administration should not be confused with the administration of development , the first one emphasis on improving the capacity of development in administration while the second one relays on achieving development through administration, but both work side by side as far as the final outcomes  are concerned . Though development administration works side by side to the traditional administration, it is more adaptive dynamic and flexible than traditional administration. 
As the objective of development should emphasis on social justice, trifling economic growth does not implies development in capital formation or industrialization nor it means that the overall development and growth has been achieved; due to this fact it finds its place in not only the developing countries but also in the developed countries, where social equality might not be present. A development administrative system is an open system, where participation plays an important role, i.e., it is no more remains the privilege of only the officials who holds the power and have say . This enables more innovative ideas as well as variations in processes and optimum utilization of resources.
In a country, especially , in developing countries where the availability of resources are limited, bringing together a host of groups of authorities for the achievement of common developmental goals would require a high degree of integrative capacity in an administrative organization. Verily, Development administration is characterized by high degree of coordination and integration. In Development Administrative situation, coordination is required to be affected at various levels, among different organizations and units, among various positions and functionaries and among the resources available for the achievement of goals. Lack of coordination may result into wastage of resources and mitigation of effectiveness. It calls for maintaining balance in development approach.

	<h2>Physics</h2>
	<p>If you were a physicist living at the end of the 19th century, you probably would
have been pleased with the progress that physics had made in understanding the
laws that govern the processes of nature. Newton’s laws of mechanics, including
gravitation, had been carefully tested, and their success had provided a framework
for understanding the interactions among objects. Electricity and magnetism
had been unified by Maxwell’s theoretical work, and the electromagnetic waves
predicted by Maxwell’s equations had been discovered and investigated in the
experiments conducted by Hertz. The laws of thermodynamics and kinetic theory
had been particularly successful in providing a unified explanation of a wide
variety of phenomena involving heat and temperature. These three successful
theories—mechanics, electromagnetism, and thermodynamics—form the basis
for what we call “classical physics.”
Beyond your 19th-century physics laboratory, the world was undergoing rapid
changes. The Industrial Revolution demanded laborers for the factories and
accelerated the transition from a rural and agrarian to an urban society. These
workers formed the core of an emerging middle class and a new economic order.
The political world was changing, too—the rising tide of militarism, the forces
of nationalism and revolution, and the gathering strength of Marxism would
soon upset established governments. The fine arts were similarly in the middle
of revolutionary change, as new ideas began to dominate the fields of painting,
sculpture, and music. The understanding of even the very fundamental aspects of
human behavior was subject to serious and critical modification by the Freudian
psychologists.
In the world of physics, too, there were undercurrents that would soon cause
revolutionary changes. Even though the overwhelming majority of experimental
evidence agreed with classical physics, several experiments gave results that were
not explainable in terms of the otherwise successful classical theories. Classical
electromagnetic theory suggested that a medium is needed to propagate electromagnetic waves, but precise experiments failed to detect thismedium. Experiments
to study the emission of electromagnetic waves by hot, glowing objects gave
results that could not be explained by the classical theories of thermodynamics
and electromagnetism. Experiments on the emission of electrons from surfaces
illuminated with light also could not be understood using classical theories.
These few experiments may not seem significant, especially when viewed
against the background of the many successful and well-understood experiments
of the 19th century. However, these experiments were to have a profound and
lasting effect, not only on the world of physics, but on all of science, on the
political structure of our world, and on the way we view ourselves and our place
in the universe. Within the short span of two decades between 1905 and 1925, the
shortcomings of classical physics would lead to the special and general theories
of relativity and the quantum theory.
The designation modern physics usually refers to the developments that began
in about 1900 and led to the relativity and quantum theories, including the
applications of those theories to understanding the atom, the atomic nucleus and
the particles of which it is composed, collections of atoms in molecules and solids,
and, on a cosmic scale, the origin and evolution of the universe. Our discussion
of modern physics in this text touches on each of these areas.
We begin our study in this chapter with a brief review of some important
principles of classical physics, and we discuss some situations in which classical</p>
